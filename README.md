This project is a **natal chart calculation and visualization service** built with **FastAPI** + **Swiss Ephemeris (pyswisseph)**.  
The frontend uses **AstroChart.js** to render the chart, displaying planetary positions, house cusps, and aspect tables.  
If a Gemini API key is provided, the system can also generate **AI-powered astrological analysis in Traditional Chinese**.
